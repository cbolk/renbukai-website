# renbukai-website
website re-design ... hopefully responsive

## php + json version
php is used to 
+ contextualize the menu (timetable schedule according to the month)
+ create the list of stages 
+ create the photo galleries

## javascript + json version
for webservers not supporting php -- not used at present, and not aligned with the up-to-date php version

## todo 
+ support for writing the stage list json file through a back-end
+ support for managing photo galleries through a back-end
